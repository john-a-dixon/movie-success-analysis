# Movie Success Analysis

## Overview

### Goal
Given data about movies, discern various trends for the stakeholder that'll help them understand what makes a movie successful. Then, using statistical analysis, test various hypotheses proposed by the stakeholder to verify (with certainty) what makes a movie successful, specifically with regard to MPAA Rating, Budget, and Revenue.

> _**Note**: The analysis uses data from 2000-2010 only._
